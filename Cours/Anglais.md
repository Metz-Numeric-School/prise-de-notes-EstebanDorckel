For the advantages of the electric car, we can name the price of fuel which is better than petrol in the long term. Then there is the noise which is reduced and it is also better for the ecology.
For the desadvantages ther are not enough charging stations and it's complicated to do a long travel. For exemple it's impossible to cross a desert with an electric car. Then there is the price of the electric car which is higher than the petrol car. Finally, when the car is at the end of its life, the battery must be recycled.
